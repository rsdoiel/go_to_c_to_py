# Go to C to Python 3

    Learning to use ctypes in Python 3.

This is an experiment learning how to pass Go 1.9.2 functions that generate string
contet and expose those results in Python 3.x via ctypes Python module.

So far this is failing. Hypothisis is it fails do to my time away from the Python :-)
